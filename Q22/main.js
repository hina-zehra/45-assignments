// Q 22: Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to make one happen. Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.
var friends = ["Waliha", "Amna", "Fatima"];
console.log("hi ".concat(friends[3], " would you like to join me for a game?")); // intentional err the correct index should be (2) to access fatima...
console.log("hi ".concat(friends[2], " would you like to join me for a game?")); // err corrected/resolved
