// Q12 : Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.


let friends = ["Waliha","Amna","Mariam","Fatima","Musfira","Khadija"];
for(let friend of friends){
    console.log(`Dear ${friend}, Let's chase dreams together and create memories that last a lifetime.`);
}
