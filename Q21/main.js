// Q21 : They think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.
var info = {
    name: "Hina",
    dateOfBirth: "1-2-2001",
    placeOfBirth: "karachi",
};
console.log("my name is ".concat(info.name, ". I was born on ").concat(info.dateOfBirth, ", in the city named ").concat(info.placeOfBirth, " "));
