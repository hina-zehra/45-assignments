// Q21 : They think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.

let info = {
    name : "Hina" ,
    dateOfBirth : "1-2-2001" ,
    placeOfBirth:"karachi",
 }
 console.log(`my name is ${info.name}. I was born on ${info.dateOfBirth}, in the city named ${info.placeOfBirth} `)
