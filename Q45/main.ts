// Q 45 : Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function info( 
    manufacturer:string,
    modelName:string,
    ...options:[string,any][]
    ){
        let car = {manufacturer,modelName};
        options.forEach(([key,value])=>{
            car[key]=value;
        }
    );
    return car;
}


console.log(info("honda","civic",["color", "white"],["sunroof",false]));
console.log(info("tesla", "Model S", ["color", "black"], ["Electric-powered", true]));
