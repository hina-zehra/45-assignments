// Q14 : Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guests : string[] = ["Waliha","Musfira","Khadija","Amna"]
for(let guest of guests){
    console.log(`Dear ${guest}, would you like to join me for a dinner? `)
}

// or
// casual invitations..!
// let friends = ["amna","fatima","marry"]
// friends.forEach(friend =>{
//     console.log(`hi ${friend}, can you come over for a dinner ?`)
// })
