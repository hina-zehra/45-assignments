// Q 42: Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

let magicians : string[]=["magician1","magician2","magician3"];

function showMagicians(magicians:string[]){
    for(let magician of magicians){
        console.log(magician);
    }
}

function make_great(magicians: string[]) {
    magicians.forEach((magician, i) => {
        magicians[i] = "the Great " + magician;
    });
}

//with for loop 

// function makeGreat(magicians:string[]){
//     for(let i = 0 ; i<magicians.length ; i++){
//       magicians[i] = magicians[i]+" the great!"
//     }
// }

make_great(magicians);
showMagicians(magicians);
